List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:


1. 	in WordFinder.java, I don't know why I can not use the get() method in TreeMap, 
	so I choose to use entrySet and iterator, which is very complex and stupid.
	
2.  I think the logic and the method I use is correct, but the arraylist store in map is empty, 
	there is no bugs so I don't know why there is no output.
	I think the problem is in AnagramDictionary class, the getAnagramsOf(String s) method. 
	
	if (dircStr.equals(s)) {
	   anaArrList.add(dircStr);
	   System.out.println(anaArrList);
	}
	
	there is problem, the anaArrList is empty, I don't know why. If this method can be realized, everything will be ok.
