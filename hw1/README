List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?

Answer: the probability of two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails are 25%, 50%, 25% respectively. Assume there are two coins A and B, there are four cases: both A and B are head;
	both A and B are tails; A is head while B is tail; A is tail while B is tail. So there is 25% possibility each. However, we can regard "A is head while B is tail" and "A is tail while
	B is head" as one condition, therefore the possibility of "one coin is head while the other coin is tail" is 50%.

2. Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

Answer: about 1000.

3. Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. 
   You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text).
   Play around with your program to verify that it actually works for very large values that are within the limits. 
   Warning: For very large values you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results (probably slower on aludra than on you own machine).

Answer: It worked at 2147483647 trials. It stopped working after I tried 2147483648. 
	Because the number 2147483647 is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing, where the 1 int = 4 byte, 1 byte = 8 bits.
